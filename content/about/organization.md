I envision the responsibilities of this position to be as follows, in order of decreasing importance:
1. Actively encourage TLUG members to write high-quality articles that can be published on the TLUG site.
1. Ensure that submitted articles meet minimal standards of quality as described above.
1. Guide those articles through the submission process, as outlined by [Articles:Policies:Process](/articles/policies/process/).
1. Work with the sysadmins to make sure our bandwidth can scale to handle demand for articles.
1. Work with the author to publicise his articles.
1. Recruit language-specific editors to provide the same services for articles written in languages other than English.

Due to the nature of the position, only native-level English speakers should apply.
