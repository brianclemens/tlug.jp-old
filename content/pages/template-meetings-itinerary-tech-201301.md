1. "Nagira - Nagios RESTful API" by [Dmytro Kovalov](/dmytro kovalov/)
Nagira is open source project for development of web services API for
popular monitoring system Nagios.

RESTful API allows remote access to read configuration data and object
status database of Nagios. Using same HTTP(S) protocol Nagira also allows
to submit passive check results for hosts and service checks. In future
versions planned also to be able to change Nagios configuration and control
Nagios server.

Using webservices API would allow:

- Distributed monitoring using multiple Nagios instances and integrating
services information in single dashboard;
- Service checks aggregation from single or multiple Nagios instance into
composite check(s)
- Modular monitoring setups for applications with RESTful API's
