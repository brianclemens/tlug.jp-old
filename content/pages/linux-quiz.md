title: Linux Quiz
---

The general idea of the *Linux Quiz* is to use quiz questions as starting
points for discussions where participants with less experience can learn new
things from the particpants with more experience, who can share their
knowledge, hopefully making the quiz fun for people of all experience levels.

1. Suggestions

- Make all participants write down their answer before sharing possible answers.  Perhaps participants can use <tt>man</tt> all they want but avoid using the Internet to search or answers.

- Turn the quiz into a contest, where more than one person "races" to complete tasks.  This type of quiz would probably be pretty exciting.
