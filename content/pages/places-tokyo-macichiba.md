1. Discovery By
{{ML|0706/msg00257|Mattia Dongili}}:
 I've found this one recently: http://www.macichiba.com/
 they are in Akihabara (what a surprise), 東京都千代田区外神田3-12-15
 paste it in google maps and you're done :) (well they also have a map on
 the website).
 
 Well, obviously I can't guarantee for the quality of their used
 appliances, but take a look.
 There are more shops around that have Ibooks, but this one has a
 dedicated floor.
