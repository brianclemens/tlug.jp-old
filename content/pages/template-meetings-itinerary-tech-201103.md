1. "A taste of Digital Forensics, a la open source" by [Kalin Kozhuharov](/kalin kozhuharov/)

The first speaker Kalin Kozhuharov will give a gentle introduction into 
the field of Digital Forensics (DF) which was a central part of his last 
job and will be a major component of his new consulting business 
starting this March.  In addition to the general concepts of DF, some of 
the more popular open-source tools will be mentioned. Finally Kalin will 
try to shed some light on a few cases involving DF that came in public 
recently.
