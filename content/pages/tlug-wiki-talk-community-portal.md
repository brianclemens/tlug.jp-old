1. Where to redirect?
The "Community portal" being visible by everybody, would not it be better to redirect to the [Main Page](/main page/) rather than to [TlugAdmin:StartPage](/tlugadmin/startpage/), which gives a scary "Permission error" to most people ? I think that a "community portal" should be a welcoming place. Cheers, [Nicolas Raoul](/user/nicolas raoul/) 17:06, 1 May 2009 (JST)
