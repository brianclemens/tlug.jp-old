1. Itinerary

1. Presentations

1. Raspberry Pi in Japan (by [Masafumi Ohta](/masafumi ohta/))
Ohta-san will present a report on the activities of the RPi community
in Japan that took place throughout 2013. He will also talk about his
plans to hold an event early in 2014, when Eben Upton is scheduled to
come to Japan.

1. Introduction to Docker (by [Travis Cardwell](/travis cardwell/))
Full virtualization has been around since the 1960s, but increased
hardware speeds allowed the technology to revolutionize commodity
server and workstation infrastructure in the mid-2000s.  Similarly,
operating system-level virtualization has its roots in FreeBSD jails,
dating back to 1998, but the release of Docker in 2013 allows easy use
of Linux containers and is bringing about another revolution.  In this
presentation, Travis will explain the technology behind Docker and
demonstrate its use.  Change the way you use Linux!
