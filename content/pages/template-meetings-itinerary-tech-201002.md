**"Nmap: The Network Mapper"** By *[(Karamoon)](Matthew)(/matthew (karamoon)/)*

Fyodor's Nmap port scanner is an essential open-source tool for sysadmins, penetration testers and curious people. It is also one of the few pieces of software to have achieved cult status, being featured in movies as bad as The Matrix Reloaded and Die Hard 4.

This talk will begin with a brief overview of port scanning for those unfamiliar with the topic. The main uses of Nmap will then be discussed, as well as different types of scans, scan optimization, OS detection and defense against port scanning.
