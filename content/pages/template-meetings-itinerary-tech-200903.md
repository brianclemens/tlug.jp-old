1. << Presentation (1) >>
**"Cracking Japanese text apart with Mecab"** By *Akira Kurogane*

Mecab is a well-regarded natural language processing library for
Japanese text. Already it is an important tool for linguistic study
and no doubt is used in many search tools, but a third use has been
found- helping non-native readers learn nihongo as they read it (e.g.
on the web). Some methodology explained, and some demonstrations
given.

**Links related to the talk:**

Firefox add-on for easy demonstration of Mecab: [xpcom-mecab](http://code.google.com/p/xpcom-mecab/) 

[Furigana Injector](http://code.google.com/p/furigana-injector/). (N.B. Please download from the development homepage link to the left. The last version released on the official Mozilla Add-ons site is an old one that does not apply Mecab.)

[Main homepage for Mecab](http://mecab.sourceforge.net/)
Mailing list for [developers](http://lists.sourceforge.jp/mailman/listinfo/mecab-devel), [users](http://lists.sourceforge.jp/mailman/listinfo/mecab-users)

Package names for the compiled command-line programs are simply "mecab", "mecab-devel", etc.. The usual dictionary to use is IPADIC, i.e. package "mecab-ipadic". (In some distributions the dictionary may be available in different charsets, e.g. mecab-ipadic-utf8. Use whichever you like.) There is also a MacPort (at least for older versions) and a Windows installer.
