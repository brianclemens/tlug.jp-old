1. Itinerary
**"Introduction to Snakemake" - by [Raymond Wan](/raymond wan/)**

Snakemake is a workflow definition language similar to
Make that is gradually becoming popular in the field of
bioinformatics.  Even so, there is nothing about Snakemake that limits
its use to bioinformatics.  Unlike Make, the Snakemake language is
Python-based.  In this talk, I will introduce Snakemake and provide
examples of how it can be used for data analysis.

** "VDO, transparent Linux compression/de-duplication layer" by [Christian Horn](/christian horn/) **

- Use cases: where can VDO help?
- VDO setup and configuration
- How is VDO influencing read/write performance?
- How much storage space can I save for my use cases?

** "Linux on the Nintendo Switch" - by [Christian Horn](/christian horn/) **

- Why is Linux@nintendo-switch interesting at all, what is required to get it running?
- What works, what works not, on various distros? What is the Linux installation looking like?
- Demo (will be hard to show it nicely, as HDMI output is not working and the internal screen is small)

** "Introduction to Matrix, a platform for unified, decentralised, secure communication" - by [Alexey Rusakov](/alexey rusakov/) **

The talk will discuss Matrix (https://www.matrix.org), an open network
for real-time communications. I will describe its main features (servers
federation, end-to-end encryption, bridging) and show what sets Matrix
apart from many other messengers. I'll further talk about how one can
use Matrix to bridge communities across other networks, both proprietary
and open, including IRC, Telegram and Slack. An overview of the
ecosystem and a short demo will conclude the talk.

1. After

After the technical meeting we will move on to the [Oktober Fest at Hibiya park](https://www.oktober-fest.jp/hibiya/), where [Benjamin Kowarsch](/benjamin kowarsch/) has informed us he will be
serving at the stall for "[Weltenburger](https://www.weltenburger.de/sortiment/), the world's oldest abbey
brewery, in operation since at least AD 1035 in Bavaria."
