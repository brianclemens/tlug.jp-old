Project Overview (Toshiharu Harada) 3min<br>if you have gmail account, please join [on-line](http://docs.google.com/Present?docid=ddbv2dj5_10fk4ghpfh&invite=cx6p78d)<br>[TOMOYO Linux](http://elinux.org/TomoyoLinux) is a Mandatory Access Control extension to Linux. The project has been trying to have their code to be merged in the mainline Linux kernel. Recent LWN article by Jonathan Corbet, ["TOMOYO Linux and pathname-based security"](http://lwn.net/Articles/277833/) is a great summary of the past and the current status. If you are familiar with SELinux or AppArmor, [the comparison chart](http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/wiki-e/?WhatIs#comparison) should give the shortest way to understand TOMOYO Linux.
1. LiveCD demonstration (Kentaro Takeda)<br>Yes, it's easier than you think. You don't have to wait the tech meeting to try TOMOYO Linux LiveCD. http://tomoyo.sourceforge.jp/wiki-e/?TomoyoLive
