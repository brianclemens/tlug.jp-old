1. Photo Album
Create a photo album giving the photo history of TLUG.

*A while back I linked the old meeting archives (most with some photos) [ *here*](/meetings/archive /) in to the wiki.  So at least there are some pics, albeit very low res for the early digi cam pics.* - [ Tim Meggs](/user/tim/)

1. Celebration Party
- The intention was to hold this on a Friday or Saturday night in June which seems to be around the time of the first meeting.
- We have had an expression of interest in sponsoring a TLUG anniversary party but nothing confirmed.
** Perhaps it would be better to look for a number of smaller sponsors rather then one individual sponsor.
- Depending on how many people are interested in attending it might be worth having this catered.
** Based on a the responses to initial announcement we expect at least 50 people would attend.
