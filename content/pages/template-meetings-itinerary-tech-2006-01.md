1. Agenda
1. Presentations

1. << Presentation (1) >>
**"OpenBlockS: Back to the Basics"** by *[Servomaa](Henri)(/henri servomaa/)*

[Servomaa](Henri)(/henri servomaa/) will introduce the OpenBlockS, a very small form factor
(118mm wide by 84mm deep by 52mm high!) server-in-a-box which supports
both CF and HD operation and is designed for 24/7 use. It has two
ethernet ports and because it runs Linux, it can be used for various
networking / datacenter tasks. Henri will give an overview of the
hardware and examples of common (and uncommon) networking setups.

**"Fun with chroot Jails"** by *[Sauco](Mauro)(/mauro sauco/)*

[Sauco](Mauro)(/mauro sauco/) will demonstrate various ways in which chroot can help you
to make friends and influence people, including: running one Linux
distribution inside another; hosting high-performance virtual servers;
increasing the security of virtually any common server daemon. And
probably much much more!
