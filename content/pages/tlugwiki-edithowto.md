= TLUG Wiki Edit HOWTO =

1. Groups
We currently have 4 tiers of groups on this wiki
- tlug-admin - Have the power of a mediawiki bureaucrat + sysop. Only tlug-admins can approve users into 'tlug' group status.
- tlug - Authenticated users with normal mediawiki user rights
- user - May only view the wiki, can start talks (ok?)
- anonymous - May only view the wiki, no edits at all

1. Becoming a TLUG User
1. Create a wiki user account
1. Make sure to authenticate yourself
1. An email will be sent to the wiki admins pending for approval
1. Wait to be approved into the **tlug** group
1. Edit to your heart's content

1. Becoming a TLUG Admin User
The same as Normal Users but you also need to become approved as a tlug wiki admin.  Ask on the TLUG admin mailing list until we have a process in place.

1. Getting Started
1. Create your user page so people can know who you are (create a user page even if you want to remain anonymous, even if you just put a witty remark there). Example: [User:Jmglov](/user/jmglov/)
