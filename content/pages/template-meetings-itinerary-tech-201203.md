1. "A taste of Digital Forensics, a la open source" by [Kalin Kozhuharov](/kalin kozhuharov/)
A year after the 3/11, Kalin will give a gentle overview into the
field of Digital Forensics (DF) which is one of the main areas of his
consulting work. To top up the general concepts of DF, some of the
more popular open-source tools will be shown in action. Depending on
time/interest, he will try to shed some light on recent DF cases that
became public and, of course, answer questions.

1. "OWASP-Open Web Application Security Project" by [Marat Vyshegorodtsev](/marat vyshegorodtsev/) and [Benny Ketelslegers](/benny ketelslegers/)

OWASP-Open Web Application Security Project is an opensource
webapplication security project featuring tools and secure development
methodology. We will talk shortly about the local Japan chapter, secure
coding practices (OWASP top 10 security risks) and show you how to test
your own web application with common attack methodologies with a demo of
Webgoat.
