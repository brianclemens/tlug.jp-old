1. Presentations

1. Visualising Trees and Graphs using TCL/TK and GraphViz (by [Kowarsch](Benjamin)(/benjamin kowarsch/))
This is a rather more practical presentation of tree and graph
visualisation in two parts:

(1) Rendering syntax diagrams using TCL/TK

In this part Benjamin will show how he generates and renders nice looking
syntax diagrams (aka railroad diagrams) with an open source TCL/TK script
and how you can modify the script for your own needs.

(2) Generating syntax trees and rendering them with GraphViz

In this part Benjamin will give a basic overview of the DOT graph language
used by the open source renderer GraphViz, then he will show how he builds
syntax trees from source code to generate DOT output using his own compiler
(written in C) and then render the output with GraphViz.

Attendees are invited to pre-install TCL/TK and GraphViz on their computers
for some practical experimentation after the presentation.

1. Fire Eye Services and Technology and the role of a Linux Admin (by [Hughes ](Erin)(/erin hughes /))
A brief overview of Fire Eye(*) services and technology and how Linux
