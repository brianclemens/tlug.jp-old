"Introduction of open-source FPGA toolchains" by [Gu](Yimin)(/yimin gu/)

FPGAs are powerful devices, but the mindset different from software
development and the blackbox-like toolchains (and also ) makes it hard
to start on. Yimin Gu will introduce the status of the newly emerged
open-source FPGA toolchains. Some boards will be shown on-site.


"How efficient are architectures x86/aarch/RISC-V etc. for a workload?" by [Horn](Christian)(/christian horn/)

Let's benchmark a cpu-bound workload over systems of various
architectures, while measuring power consumption.  Who will be most
energy efficient? Christian will introduce the test setup, talk a bit
about the used software.  Then details on the benchmarked workload
("bzcat"), on the various systems he benchmarked, and then introduce and discuss the results.

1. Other items on the agenda are:
1. Introduction of new members
1. News about Linux/Open Source, general announcements, Q&A
1. Auction (bring any gear that would would like to donate to TLUG)
