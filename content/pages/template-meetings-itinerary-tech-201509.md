1. Itinerary

1. Presentations

1. Coroutines (by [Kowarsch](Benjamin)(/benjamin kowarsch/))
Coroutines are a multi-threading model that is a highly scalable
alternative to preemptive threads. There is an interesting paper called
"Revisiting Coroutines" by De Moura and Ierusalimschy of the Polytechnic
University of Rio de Janeiro, and of Lua fame. 

This paper was the basis to redesign coroutines in Modula-2. 
Benjamin will show how coroutines differ from preemptive threads and 
what kind of support there is in different languages.

1. PostgreSQL 9.4, 9.5 and Beyond (by [Nagayasu](Satoshi)(/satoshi nagayasu/))
Recently, PostgreSQL has succeeded in getting popularity among web
developers. In this talk, Satoshi will introduce the new features in
the latest release 9.4 (JSON, Analytics, Logical Decoding, etc.) to
take advantages of the latest PostgreSQL advancement, and share a
quick look in the upcoming release 9.5. And he will also introduce
his personal projects around PostgreSQL.
