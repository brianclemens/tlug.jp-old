Hello all!

I am [Nicolas Raoul](http://nrw.free.fr), open source user and contributor since 1998. I am a software engineer with a passion for Java, XML and the Semantic Web. I learn Japanese and work on [HTML5](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/markup-spec/) at Tokyo's W3C office. I live in Shimokitazawa, one of the most exciting places in Tokyo, and I love to ride my bicycle around.

Happy hacking!
Nicolas.
